What is the intent of the message? What does the user want us to help with?

Analyze the user's message and determine their primary intent. Consider:
- Are they asking about a specific place, restaurant, or attraction? → location_info
- Are they asking what they missed today in the chat? → summarize
- Are they asking about shared expenses or who owes what? → expense
- Are they asking about trip dates or how long until the trip? → countdown
- Are they asking about planned events, schedule, or timeline? → event_query
- Are they asking for recommendations or suggestions? → recommendation
- Are they asking about what to pack or creating a packing list? → packing
- Are they asking a general question about past discussions? → ask_question
- Are they asking about what the bot can do? → about

Priority order (most specific first):
1. location_info - Questions about specific places
2. event_query - Questions about schedule/events/plans
3. expense - Financial tracking
4. countdown - Trip countdown
5. recommendation - Asking for suggestions
6. packing - Packing-related questions
7. summarize - TODAY's chat summary only
8. ask_question - General KB queries

Choose the most specific intent that matches the user's request.
