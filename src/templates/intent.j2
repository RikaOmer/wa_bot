What is the intent of the message? What does the user want us to help with?

Analyze the user's message and determine their primary intent. Consider:
- Are they creating a poll/vote? (סקר, הצבעה, poll, vote, X או Y או Z) → poll
- Are they asking about the itinerary or adding to schedule? (לוח זמנים, תוכנית יום) → itinerary
- Are they asking about a specific place, restaurant, or attraction? → location_info
- Are they asking what they missed today in the chat? → summarize
- Are they asking about shared expenses or who owes what? → expense
- Are they asking about trip dates or how long until the trip? → countdown
- Are they asking about planned events, schedule, or timeline? → event_query
- Are they asking for recommendations or suggestions? → recommendation
- Are they asking about what to pack or creating a packing list? → packing
- Are they asking a general question about past discussions? → ask_question
- Are they asking about what the bot can do? → about

IMPORTANT - Poll detection patterns (these should ALWAYS be poll intent):
- "סקר:" or "סקר " followed by options
- "הצבעה:" or "הצבעה " followed by options  
- "X או Y" or "X או Y או Z" format (choosing between options)
- "poll:" or "vote:" followed by options
- Questions with multiple choices separated by "או" (or)

Priority order (most specific first):
1. poll - Creating a poll/vote between options (סקר, הצבעה, X או Y)
2. itinerary - Schedule/itinerary management
3. location_info - Questions about specific places (NOT choices between places)
4. event_query - Questions about schedule/events/plans
5. expense - Financial tracking
6. countdown - Trip countdown
7. recommendation - Asking for suggestions (NOT creating votes)
8. packing - Packing-related questions
9. summarize - TODAY's chat summary only
10. ask_question - General KB queries

Choose the most specific intent that matches the user's request.
